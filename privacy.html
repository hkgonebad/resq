                            using, email patterns, and the name of the User&rsquo;s internet service provider. This information is used
                            solely to analyze overall User trends and to help the Company in improving its Services. Please note that the
                            link between the User&rsquo;s IP address and the User&rsquo;s personally identifiable information is not shared
                            with third parties without such User&rsquo;s permission or except when required by law or to provide or
                            facilitate the User with the Services. Notwithstanding the above, the User acknowledges the Company&rsquo;s

                            unidentifiable form, and not the specific data with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic partners, and
                            others in order to help grow the business. The amount of information sent to the Company depends on the settings
                            of the web browser used by the User to access the Platforms. The User may refer to the browser used, if the User
                            wishes to learn what information is provided to the Company.</li>

                            functionality of their browsers to ensure deletion, as the Company cannot guarantee, predict or provide for the

                            computer, collect data or solicit personal information or Financial Information from the Users, for which the
                            Company shall not be held responsible or liable. The Company does not make any representations concerning the

                        <li><strong>14.</strong> The Company may choose to conduct contests and surveys to collect relevant information
                            about the Users&rsquo; preferences. These surveys and contests are optional and if the User chooses to respond,
                            his/her/its responses will be kept anonymous. The demographic information that the User provides while availing
